# Array Challenges
<ol>
<li><a href="prob1.ts">Given an array a[] of size n. For every i from 0 to n-1 output max(a[0], a[1],..., a[i]).</a>-- <a href="que1.js">In JS</a></li>

## SubArrays vs SubSequences:
### Subarray:
<ul>
<li>Continuous part of the array.
<li>Number of subarrays of an array with n elements = nC2+n = n*(n+1)/2.
<li>Single element of an array is also an subarray.
</ul>

### SubSequence:
<ul>
<li>A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived an array by selecting zero or more elements, without changing the order of the remaining elements.
<li>Number of subsequences of an array with n elements = 2^n
</ul>

>Every subarray is a subsequence but every subsequence is not a subarray.

Isyana is given the number of visitors at her local theme park on N consecutive
days. The number of visitors on the i-th day is Vi. A day is record breaking if it
satisfies both of the following conditions:<br>
● The number of visitors on the day is strictly larger than the number of
visitors on each of the previous days.<br>
● Either it is the last day, or the number of visitors on the day is strictly larger
than the number of visitors on the following day.<br><br>
Note that the very first day could be a record breaking day!
Please help Isyana find out the number of record breaking days.</a></li>

### Constraints:
1 sec = 10^8 operations(approx)
20 sec = 2 * 10^9 operations(approx)
